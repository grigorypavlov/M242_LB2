# Reflexion Grigory Pavlov

Starting this project I had some experience with C++ but not all too much with microprocessors.
Reading the IoTKit documentation helped me a lot to get used to this unique environment.
I liked this project because I work at a company that deals with IoT/Smart home devices and software and I thought I could learn some useful things.
Initially I had a few problems building libraries in the Mbed Studio but after getting it to work I could help out Colin with implementing the wanted functionality.
I'm thinking of doing something microprocessor-related in my free time somewhen in the future.
